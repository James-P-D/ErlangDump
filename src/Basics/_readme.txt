Erlang doesn't like files beginning with numbers or underscores, so they had to be renamed. General order of easy to hard is as below:

hello.erl                    
variables.erl
maths_and_logic.erl          
if_and_case.erl
strings.erl                  
tuples.erl
listtest.erl                 
type_conv.erl
recursion.erl                
mapping.erl
records.erl                  
higher_order_functions.erl   
file_io.erl
error_handling.erl           
macros.erl
concurrency.erl
